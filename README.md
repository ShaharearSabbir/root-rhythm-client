## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the Root Rhythm frontend up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
-   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-   npm or Yarn
-   Firebase CLI (if you plan to deploy to Firebase Hosting)

### Setup & Run Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the frontend repository to your local machine and navigating into its directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShaharearSabbir/root-rhythm-client
    cd root-rhythm-frontend # Or whatever your frontend folder is named
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Backend API URL (Optional, but Recommended):**
    Your frontend application will need to know the address of your deployed backend API to make requests. This is typically configured using environment variables during the build process to avoid hardcoding the URL.

    If you are using Vite (as indicated in "Technologies Used"), you would commonly create a file named `.env` in the root of your frontend project and add your backend API base URL like this:
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://root-rhythm-server.vercel.app # Replace with your actual backend URL
    ```
    * **`VITE_API_BASE_URL`**: The base URL of your deployed Root Rhythm Backend API. This variable will be exposed to your frontend code.

    **Note:** The exact prefix for environment variables (`VITE_`, `REACT_APP_`, etc.) depends on your specific build tool. Consult your framework's documentation for the preferred method.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Finally, start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The frontend application should now be running locally, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.
